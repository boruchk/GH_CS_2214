# CS_2214

This repository contains the class project for my computer architecture class.
The simcache.cpp file in Project_02 is the final (most complete) version

The program executes and runs machine code by emulating a CPU, with the following specifications:
- Parse machine code to isolate the data, instruction, memory address, and register bits
- Execute the instruction with the given data
- Implement options for L1 and/or L2 caches
